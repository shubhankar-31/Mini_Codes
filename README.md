#N_Folder.py

Version 1.0

This python can create "n" number of new folders 

Following are the steps for usage:-

•	At the beginning of the program it will display the current working directory

•	In this step the program will ask you to enter a new path for new folders.
        Following is an example:-
          F:\Job:\Company
          
•	In this step the program will ask you enter the number of new folders that you want to create
 
 

 NOTE

 In order to use this program again on the same path either delete the existing new folders or rename them to something else. 
The program cannot create folders if it already exists.
